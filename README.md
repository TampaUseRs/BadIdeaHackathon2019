Tampa Bay R Users will be hosting it's first ever Bad Idea Hackathon on December 7 at OutFast Realty!

## What we'll do 

The Bad Idea Hackathon is an opportunity for members of the Tampa Bay R Users to get together and create something. Small teams or individuals will work together to create something bad in 8 hours. During that time we will have food, drinks and programming. 

## What to bring 

Bring a laptop to work on and any food or drinks you may want during that time. We also ask that you bring a couple of dollars to pitch in for food. 

## Price 

Free!
