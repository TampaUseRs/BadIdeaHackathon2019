## Bad Idea Hackathon

Join Tampa Bay R Users for it's first ever Bad Idea Hackathon on December 7 at OutFast Realty! 

The Bad Idea Hackathon is an opportunity for members of the Tampa Bay R Users to get together and create something. Small teams or individuals will work together to create something bad in 8 hours. During that time we will have food, drinks and programming.
